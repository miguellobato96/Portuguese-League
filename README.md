Football League Table Management

This program was created to manage the standings table of the 1st Division of the Portuguese football league. It provides functionalities to update match results, graphically display the current table, and handle user authentication.

Usage:
- Reads and updates a league table stored in 'league_table.txt'.
- The user is prompted to authenticate using credentials stored in 'credentials.txt'.
- After successful authentication, a menu is presented to the user where they can choose between entering a new result, checking the table, and 'resetting' the table.
- The table is displayed using the 'matplotlib' library, and teams are sorted by points and goal difference.
- GS -> Goals Scored | GC -> Goals Conceded | GD -> Goal Difference

Notes:
- Team names are case-insensitive and can be entered in various formats for greater convenience.
- Awaiting future updates.
